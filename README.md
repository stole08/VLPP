This is repository with Void Linux Precompiled Packages for x86-64 arch, which Void Linux team don't include in official repos. Many packages are avalible, thanks to xdeb project (https://github.com/xdeb-org/xdeb) and xdeb developer, his Github: https://github.com/xdeb-org, other packages i compiled myself on my laptop. Github don't allow me to upload files bigger than 25mb. Because of that, i will share links to file hosters, where i keep files.

(I will finish when i have time)
This is my hobby repo, i will upload at my spare time.
