This is repository with Void Linux Precompiled Packages for x86-64 arch, which Void Linux team don't include in official repos. Many packages are avalible, thanks to xdeb project (https://github.com/xdeb-org/xdeb) and xdeb developer, his Github: https://github.com/xdeb-org, other packages i compiled myself on my laptop.
